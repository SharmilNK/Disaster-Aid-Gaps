The website combines narrative storytelling with data to shed light on:
- The global disaster aid gap analysis (2014-2024). 
- The top 3 countries with the largest and smallest aid gaps.
- The widening gap in disaster funding over the past decade.
- The factors that drive or limit aid distribution.
- The effect of news & media coverage on receiving aid.
